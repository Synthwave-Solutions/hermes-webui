"""Plain-English capability and risk metadata for governance approvals.

Reported 28 Aug 2026 ("Explain to administrators what they are approving"): the
approvals queue showed a derived label ("API route: /api/crons") and nothing
else, so an administrator had to already know the policy model to decide. This
module is the ONLY place a human-readable capability or risk sentence is
written; every other surface derives its text from here.

Authoritative sources, never guesses
------------------------------------
Each map is keyed off a structure that already decides the behaviour, and a
coverage test pins the key sets together so a new kind cannot ship without a
description:

    GKIND_RISKS      api.grant_requests._GRANT_TARGETS  (what approving writes)
    PERMISSION_RISKS api.governance.catalog.ROUTE_CATALOG + governance.nav
    TOOLSET_RISKS    api.config._DEFAULT_TOOLSETS
    KIND_RISKS       api.approvals.KINDS

Two things this module deliberately refuses to say:

* A route grant does NOT confer a permission. api/grant_requests.py:47-50 is
  explicit: "Approving adds the path to the user's routes allowlist; the
  permission layer still applies, so a route grant alone never confers an admin
  capability." The permission is reported as context ("still required"), never
  as the thing being granted. The spool item carries no HTTP method
  (api/grant_requests.py:132-136), so both the read and the write permission of
  the matching route rule are listed rather than one of them being picked.
* A built-in tool grant does not come with a description of the tool. The tool
  registry lives in the engine, so the honest answer is the policy effect plus
  a note that the tool itself is not described here.

No credential, header name, file content, URL or module path is written into
any sentence below, and nothing here reads a secret-bearing file.
