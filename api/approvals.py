"""Kind-aware approval registry for self-service installs.

Generalises the skills ownership model (api/skill_ownership.py, section 6 of
docs/user-isolation-design.md) to every surface a non-admin can ask for:

    skill        a user-added skill directory (delegated, see below)
    integration  a Nango provider the user wants enabled
    mcp          an MCP server the user wants added
    cli          a CLI/command the user wants allowed

A user "requests" an item; an admin approves or rejects it from the
governance approvals queue. Requests carry an optional free-form ``payload``
so the requesting surface can keep the details it needs to actually perform
the install once approved (the server command, the provider key, ...).

Storage
-------
STATE_DIR/approvals.json, mapping ``"<kind>:<key>"`` to::

    {
      "kind": "mcp",
      "key": "context7",
      "label": "Context7 MCP",
      "owner_email": "user@example.com",
      "requested_at": <epoch seconds, float>,
      "status": "pending" | "approved" | "rejected",
      "decided_by": "admin@example.com" | null,
      "decided_at": <epoch seconds, float> | null,
      "payload": {...},
      "reason": "why it was rejected" | null
    }

Writes are atomic (same-directory temp file + os.replace) and serialized
under a module lock, matching the other STATE_DIR sidecar files. Reads are
total: a corrupted or unreadable registry degrades to "nothing requested"
instead of raising.

Skills are an ADAPTER, not a copy
---------------------------------
``kind == "skill"`` never touches approvals.json. Every call is delegated to
api/skill_ownership.py so the existing skill flow, its registry file and its
visibility rule stay authoritative and byte-for-byte unchanged; this module
only translates skill_ownership rows into the entry shape above. Skill
entries therefore always carry ``payload == {}`` and ``decided_by/decided_at
== None``.

Approval scope
--------------
An approved ``integration``/``mcp``/``cli`` is approved GLOBALLY (available
to everyone) unless its payload carries ``{"scope": "owner"}``, in which case
it is approved for ``owner_email`` only. Skills follow the skill_ownership
rule (approved == global).

House style: functions raise ValueError (-> 400) and KeyError (-> 404); no
HTTP handler code and no third-party imports live here.
