"""Route catalog: maps hermes-webui API routes to governance permissions.

The RouteRule mechanism is vendored from the hermes-agent dashboard
route_catalog; the catalog CONTENT is rebuilt for the hermes-webui route
surface using ONLY permission names already granted in the canonical
~/.hermes/dashboard-governance.yaml, so the existing owner/admin/operator/
viewer roles work without any policy edit.

# error) would 403 every login attempt and brick the bootstrap admin too.
# Kept in sync with the login endpoints in api.auth.PUBLIC_PATHS; a coverage
# test asserts the two stay aligned so a new public login route cannot silently
# become un-exempt. Non-login public paths (pages, static, manifests) are not
# listed here because they are already handled by the non-/api passthrough.

# reports without credentials, and today the endpoint bypasses the hook via a
# server.py dispatch special-case; the entry here keeps it reachable even if
